# NodeJS Messages App

### Technologies used

Aside from the technologies already installed, I also used:

- Axios: For API calls to the fake User DB
- node-mailer for sending emails
- node-cron for scheduling email sending
- prettier for linting
- ts-node for typescript compilation
- dotenv for loading email configuration from .env
- material-ui for frontend component library

### Run this project locally

If you decide you want to run this project locally:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Make sure the newest of the frontend is built by running `npm run build`
3. `npm start` to start up the server, which should be running at http://localhost:8000
